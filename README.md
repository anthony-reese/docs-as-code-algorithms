# 📘 Docs-as-Code Algorithms

This repository demonstrates my approach to documenting algorithms using a **docs-as-code** workflow.  
Each document is written in Markdown and explains a LeetCode problem with clear, structured content:

- ✅ Problem summary  
- 💻 Code walkthrough (C++)  
- ⏱ Time and space complexity  
- 🧠 Conclusion  

---

## 🚀 Tech Stack

- 📝 Markdown for lightweight semantic documentation  
- 🔧 Git/GitHub for version control and change tracking  
- 🧠 VS Code / Obsidian as the authoring environment
